# ReactToDoApp

> A React powered ToDo app.

**Hey!** :blush: I develop this project by using ReactJS. Do you have any idea to develop this project further, let me know. I really appreciate it.


## :cloud: Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/janaka120/ReactToDoApp.git
cd ReactToDoApp
yarn install
yarn start
open localhost:3000

# To build the app for production, run the following command:
yarn build
```

## :sparkling_heart: Free

I like to contribute open-source projects. You can integrate and use this project in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute.

Thanks! :heart:
